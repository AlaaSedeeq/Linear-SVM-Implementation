# SVM

- A Support Vector Machine (SVM) performs classification by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The vectors (cases) that define the hyperplane are the support vectors.	

- I'm going to implement a simple version of SVM (Linear SVM).
- **Linear SVM or Simple SVM:** Linear SVM is used for linearly separable data. If a dataset can be classified into two classes with a single straight line, then that data is considered to be linearly separable data, and the classifier is referred to as the linear SVM classifier. It is typically used for linear regression and classification problems.
